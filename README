If selected, do you grant permission for your assignment to be released as an
anonymous student sample solution?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dev C++ was the environment I have used to create this assignment
I have not put the different files into different subfolders as the 
overloading section of task C is not fully complete and the isTravelPass
section I have put with Task B it will be tested when Part B print purchases
is selected.



Known bugs:
-----------



Incomplete functionality:
-------------------------
Task C - C3 and C4 overloading << and >> not complete. Also has not been tested for
memory leaks.


Assumptions:
------------
Assumed that for the isTravelPass method the bool was used to tell the
difference between the derived classes so I have used it to differentiate
between the passes for Zone 1 and the passes for Zone 1 and 2. The test for this
is in the print passes option this option will print the passes then print the
amount of passes for Zone 1 and the amount for Zones 1 and 2.


SECTION C 
Answer to Array of TravelPass Objects vs. Array of TravelPass 
Pointers:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
As TravelPass is abstract it cannot be instantiated, so an array of pointers
is needed. And if the TravelPass was not an abstract class we would get object
slicing.

Any other notes for the marker:
